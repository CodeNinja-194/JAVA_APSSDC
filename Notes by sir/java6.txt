Exception:

it is an abnormal condition.

which interuptes the normal flow of execution.

1 to 10 statements.
 7 th statement, error or ecception.
 Stops the excutioon of flow..
 

 Handling:
 
  means handle or recity 
  
  Exception Handling:
    it is used to handle the runtime exceptions.
	
	
	Exceptions:
	
	1.Checked Exception ---> occurs on conmpile-time 
	ex: IO Excetions, SQLExection
	
	2 uncheckked Exception ---> occurs on run time.
	
	ex; nullpoint exception,Arthimatic Exception.
	3.Error  --> we can nor change or rectify the exception.
	 Virtual machine Error,Out of memeory error.
	
	Java Keywords;
	
	1.try{
	//Block of Code.
	}
	2.catch{
	
	//Exception block/
	}
	
	it can be followed by finally block.
	3.finally--> used to execute the code wheather exception occures or not.
	4.throw--> it throw exception
	5.throws--->it delclre exception ,it is always used  with method signature.
  
  
  
  java.lang.Throwable class
  
               Throwable
			   
			   
	Exceptions
	
	1.Checked --> IO Exception
	              SQl Exception   
				  Class not found exception

	2. Unchecked or runtime --> Arthimatic
								Null ponit exception
								number format exception
				indes out of bound exception
				
				
	ERROR: -->Stack over flow
				Virtual Machine error
				out of memory error.
				
				
				
Points to remember whe using multiple catch:

1. at a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is excuted.
	
	
	Nested Try Block:
	
	a try block within a try block is known as nested try block:
	
	Synatax;
	try{
	
	Statement();
	Statement1();
	try{
	
	Statement2();
	Statement3();
	}
	Catch()
	{
	catch statement;
	}
	}
	Catch ()
	{
	Statement;
	}
	
	Throw Exception:
	
	It is used to throw an exception explicitly.
	 syntax:
	 
	 throw exception;
	 
	 
	 
	 final ,finally and finalize
	 
	 final is a keyword.
	 finally is a block .
	 finalizer is a method.
	 
	 
	 MultiThreading:
	  it is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
	  
	  Thread:
	  
	   it is a unit of process.
	   
	   multiprocessing + multithreading = Multitasking
	   
	   Adavntages:
	   
	  1.we can perform many operations.
	  2.Threds are independent.
	  
	  Life cycle of thread.
	  
	  
	 5 States.
	 
	 1.new-->create instance of thread class.
	 2.runnable-->Start();
	 3.running-->
	-- 4.non-runnaable-->
	 5.teminated
	 
	 creation of thread:
	 
	 1.by extending Thread class
	 
	 methods used in thread class:
	 1 void start();
	 2. void run();
	 3. void sleep();
	 4 .void join();
	 5. string getName();
	 6.void setName();
	 
	 Constructors in Thread class:
	  1.Thread()
	  2.Thread(String Name)
	  3.Thread (runnable r)
	  4 Thread (String namre.runnable r)
	 
	 2 by implementing Runnable interface
	 
	 void run();
	 
	 
	 
	 Priority Thread;
	 
	 in between 1 to 10;
	 
	 it depends up on JVM.
	 1. public static int min_priority-->1
	 2. public static int max_priority-->10
	 3. public static int norm_priority.-->5
