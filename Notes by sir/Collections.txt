Collection in java

  framework-- means It is MVC--
  M-Model  v-VIEW  C-Controller
  
  it is an architecture  to store and manipulate the group of objects.
 collection and Collection framwork
 
 Collection means -- a unit of object .
 Colection framework-- it is architecture which represents 
  set of classes and interfaces
  
  Hierarchy of Collection framework.

List Interface

1. it can store the elements in ordered collection.
2. it can have duplicate elements.

Syntax:

List <Datatype> li = new ArratList();


1.ArrayList
2.LinkedList
3.Vector

add()
addall()
add Element()
capacity()clear()containsall()


4.Stack	

linear data structure to store the elements.
LIFO--Lastin first out.
1,2,3,4


4,3,2,1//pop method

3,2,1

Queue --> Interface:

First in first out order.(FIFO)

1.Dqueue-->Interface
  it is an interface that supports elements insertion and removal from both ends.
  dqueue--double ended queue
  
  boolean add();
  object poll();
  
2.ArrayDeque---> Class

this class is used to present the facility of using deque and resizable array.

1. it is same Queue.add or remove elements from both ends.
2.Null elements are not allowed.
3.it is not thred safe.
4.it is faster than linked list and stack.


3.PriorityQueue ---> Class (no FIFO)



Set:

Set Interface ,it represents the values in unorderd set of elements. 
it does not allow dulicate elements.
syntax:

set<datatype> s1=new Hastset or LinkedHashSet or TreeSet<datatype>


1.HashSet

Hash table for storing or manipulating elements.

1. it stores the elements using Hash Table or Hashing.
2.It contains Unique Values.
3.It allows null values.
4.it is non syncronized.
5.it does not allow insertion order.it allows the order by using hash table.



Note:

Hash Table-->Entity[] Entity (key,value)

Dafaulty capacity of string in hash table is 16

Loading factor:  no of key divided by capacity.

dafault value =0.75

2.Linked hashSet

 it extend hashset,abstractset and implements set,collection


1. it contains unique elements same as hash set.
2. it is non synchronised class.
3. it allows null elements.
4. it maintains insertion order.

3.Treeset

it extend Abstractset and implements Set interface.
 --> it provides ascending order.
 --> it does not allow null values.
 --> it is non synchronized.
 
 note: pollFirst() and pollLast()
  
4.SortedSet


Map:

it uses Entity () where key and value are present.


1.TreeMap
 
 TreeMap(key,value) extend AbstractMap(key,value) implements NavigableMap


 --> it contains values based on key.
 -->it contains unique elements.
 -->it can not have null key but it can have null vales.
 -->it is also non synchronised.
 --> it also provides asending order.
 --> it does not allow duplicate keys,it allows duplicate values.
 
 

2.LinkedHashMap

it extend HashMap and implents Map

-->It contains values based on keys.
-->it contains Unique Elements.(K,V)
--> it may have one null key and multiple null values.
--> it maintains insertion order.



3 Hash Map:
	
Iterator interface:
 it provides the facility of iterating the elements in forwad direction only.
 method in iterator interface;
1.public  boolean hasNext()
2.public Objectnext()
3 public void remove()
