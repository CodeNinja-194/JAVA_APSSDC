try	------The try block governs the statements that are enclosed within it 
          and defines the scope of exception handler associated with it. Try block follows catch or finally or both.
catch--- The catch block is used to handle the exception. 
         It must be preceded by try block which means we canâ€™t use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.
finally---When an exception is raised, the statement in the try block is ignored,
           some times it is necessary to process certain statements irrespective of wheather an exception is raised or not,
		   the finally block is used for this purpose.
throw---The throw class is used to call exception explicitly. 
           You may want to throw an exception when the user enters a wrong login ID and pass word,
		   you can use throw statement to do so. The throw statement takes an single argument, 
		   which is an Object of exception class.
throws---The throws statement species the list of exception that has thrown by a method. 
         If a method is capable of raising an exception that is does not handle,
		 it must specify the exception has to be handle by the calling method, this is done by using the throw statement.
