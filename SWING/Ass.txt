I choose two different Websites 
1.facebook 2.netflix
a.both have clear navigation but it is little in netflix.
b.it is easy to understand the UI.
c.it doesnot have any other unnecessary elements.
d.ha,quite clear and also the website is light in facebook and overcrowded and in netflix same thing happenend
e.ha but as u know in netflix its ask about the membership in order to access the next details/movies.
f.casual and friendly 
g.1.Social Media 2.Entertainment Website
h.inorder to use their websites and their apps in order increase their usage 
i.nothing but in netflix i wanted to change a little bit on the ui in which every thing is paid and i allow to access somefree movies
